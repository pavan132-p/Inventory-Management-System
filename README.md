# Inventory-Management-System
In this project, I developed an Inventory Management System using JavaScript and Node.js to manage inventory for a warehouse. The goal was to create a system that allows adding, updating, removing, searching, and reporting on items in the inventory. This project helped reinforce JavaScript programming skills, especially in object-oriented concepts, and provided practical experience with implementing common data manipulation operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

Project Objective
The objective was to build a JavaScript-based Inventory Management System that can perform key warehouse management tasks. The system includes methods for adding items, updating quantities, removing items, searching for items, and generating stock level reports, providing a comprehensive tool for managing warehouse inventory effectively.

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: JavaScript
Runtime Environment: Node.js
Outcome
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript object-oriented programming and data manipulation methods. The Inventory Management System effectively demonstrated my ability to create and manage data-driven applications, which will be valuable in building more complex systems in the future.
